## rogue-classic algorithm in javascript

![demo.gif](./demo.gif)

Currently just a little prototype, but seems to work pretty well so far.  I ran into a lot of different issues while making it and for the most part it was a blast!
I've been following a guide to build this algorithm, which is also included with the repo (see guide.md)

## Install

Use git clone, then npm install to setup

## Use

Currently this just dumps the map into standard output whenever you run `node index`
