## rogue-classic algorithm in javascript
This is just the map generation
[![rogue-classic-dev1.gif](https://gifyu.com/images/rogue-classic-dev1.gif)](https://gifyu.com/image/SXNW)

Currently just a little prototype, but seems to work pretty well so far.  I ran into a lot of different issues while making it and for the most part it was a blast!
I've been following a guide to build this algorithm, which is also included with the repo (see guide.md)

## Install

Use git clone, then npm install to setup

## Use

Currently this just dumps the map into standard output whenever you run `node index`
